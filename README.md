# DH 110 Assignment 8: Porfolio and Video Pitch
# Improving the Food Services for Students at College of the Desert 
By Stacey Amery Dela Serna

## Introduction
Food is essential to living and thriving. It’s our source of energy to the mind and the body. One of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, Zero Hunger, is to create a world free of hunger by 2030. In the United States, more than 34 million people, including 9 million children, are food insecure. Food insecurity means lack of access to an affordable, nutritional diet. Almost 10% of the population on a global scale experience hunger. This number will only increase due to the effects of the pandemic, politics, and climate change. 

## Design Statement
College of the Deserts website seems miniscule compared to the grander issue of World Hunger. Nevertheless, it’s a start to combat the relentless hunger issue. My alma mater was inadequate in promoting its services of basic needs like free food, so improvement on the website can increase awareness to more students and surrounding communities. After all, who doesn’t like free food? When a person can fulfill the primary needs of the human body, they are able to better focus on other aspects in life. I want to create a website with features that can easily be used by anyone since community college has a highly diverse background for the students so that people who need the help, can get help quickly and seamlessly. 

P.S. This was a project for Digital Humanities 110 UI/UX in Fall 2022. 

## Competitor Analysis
### Heuristic Evaluation
The purpose of the heuristic evaluation is to scope out the existing services and decipher the gaps between the features and the user. In other words, a missing piece to the answer. College of the Desert’s website and FoodPantries.Org are the two products that I conducted a heuristic evaluation on. Food Pantries.Org had a better search system to find nearby food pantries, but was bare with features. College of the Desert was more well-rounded, but was deficient in promotion and features for the free food services. Heuristics lays the foundation on what qualities the product or should be.

### Usability Testing
After findings from the heuristic evaluation, further investigation is necessary for improvement of the website.  A critical part of the UX process is usability testing (UT) to collect empirical and numerical data on the website through a participant's performance of realistic tasks. The areas of focus for the College of the Desert’s website was finding the food pantries page, the campus resources, and enrollment into College of the Desert. UT offered me an insight into how users might interact and react to certain obstacles, which therefore gives me a better understanding for the future of the design process.

## User Research
### Contextual Inquiry
Even though I already had an idea of what I wanted the product to look like, I interviewed a friend I met during College of the Desert on Zoom to better understand a college level student’s knowledge on food insecurity. After several background questions, I asked how she can find these facts and other food resources available. It turns out that she experienced food insecurity herself during her childhood and described in detail how it impacted other areas in her life. 

To this day, she still faces semi-food insecurity as a commuting college student due to an awkwardly spaced class plan and difficulty finding a job that fits around those classes.  I really appreciated her taking the time to go over the contextual inquiry with me and giving me the opportunity to learn, especially because she would often read between the lines of the statistics and tell anecdotal evidence to back the statistics up. She emphasized that some people who are undergoing food insecurity are not mentally ready to go to these free food services like shy or embarrassed about their situation. And since college is already a lot on people’s plates, make it as easy as possible to find this information. 

With these insights, I revised my original idea for potential users and design of the website.
